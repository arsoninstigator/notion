# notion â™¡
a series of notion pages (all-access dashboard, planners, trackers, journals, to-do lists, relevant school notes etc.) created by me to manage my schoolwork + personal projects efficiently and curate my life through the use of cute and aesthetic notes, widgets and visually appealing fonts and icons.
